# Jest workshop

Hi, I wrote this jest-test-workshop to help developers from the Javascript/TypeScript eco-system to start test their code easily.
Personally I use Jest because it is the most popular framework today to test JS/TS code and also I love its interface.

The workshop includes

1. Jest setup
2. Testing examples for
   1. business-logic/pure-logic/helper-functions you name it, the bottom line is logic that is happening in your code internally, without calling any external component.
   2. Mock DB - I will give examples with MongoDB.
   3. Mock request to external service/API, I will use axios.

I will implement 1 & 2 for both Javascript and Typescript.
